# Tic Tac Toe with Minimax Algorithm

This project is an implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe using the Minimax algorithm for AI decision-making.

## Description

Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game where each player takes turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. In this project, the game is implemented with an unbeatable AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm.

## Features

- Play Tic Tac Toe against a human or an AI opponent.
- AI opponent uses the Minimax algorithm to make optimal moves.
- User-friendly interface with simple controls.

## Technologies Used
- Minimax algorithm for AI decision-making.
-Java Progarmming for logic implementation

## Getting Started

To play the game, simply open the code in any ide which have jdk environment installed.

## Usage

- Choose whether you want to play against another human or against the AI.
- Click on the grid to place your mark (X or O).
- The AI will automatically make its move.
- Continue playing until someone wins or the game ends in a draw.
